Task 1/2: Refactoring techniques

Developers refactor code to achieve different goals.
Sometimes, refactoring is the goal in itself: for example, when splitting one monolith project into several microservices.
It affects many parts of the codebase and is called _**root-canal**_ refactoring.

In other cases, developers may perform refactorings while solving other tasks, such as developing a new feature or
fixing a bug, and it’s called _**floss refactoring**_.
In this case, refactoring is secondary to the main changes.

There are two ways to perform refactorings:
- _Manually_: it is time-consuming and error-prone.
- _Using automatic refactorings_: it requires knowledge of how refactoring works and of the IDE features to invoke it.

There are many refactoring techniques. In this course, we will cover the most popular ones supported by IDEs, more specifically, by IntelliJ IDEA. However, refactoring techniques are language-independent and may be applied across different languages and IDEs.
